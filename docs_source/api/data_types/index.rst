 data_types package
####################

This package contains a number of data types used in variable typing.

They are here because they get reused a lot and can just get imported
rather than redeclared everywhere they are needed.

It also helps track where a given data type is used.

If the data type you are using is included in here you should import it
from here rather than redeclaring it.
